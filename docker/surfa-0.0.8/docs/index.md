Surfa is a collection of Python (3.5+) utilities for medical image analysis and mesh-based surface processing. It provides tools that operate on 3D image arrays and triangular meshes with consideration of their representation in a world (or scanner) coordinate system. While broad in scope, surfa is developed with particular emphasis on neuroimaging applications, as it is an extension of the [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) brain analysis software suite.
